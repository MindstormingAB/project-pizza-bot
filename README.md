# Pizza Bot

The purpose of this week was to use JavaScript to create a pizza bot. 

The project was based on pair programming and I collaborated with Karan Mann. We switched role between navigator and driver and committed our code after each iteration.

## The problem

We applied a mobile first approach, with slightly different media quesries for tablet and desktop.
We first achieved the iterations as described in the brief (as you can check in the first commits) before we started to make the bot questions and the customer answers visual in the HMTL. 
The collaboration went weel and we reached the blue level on Wednesday as planned. We struggled a bit with the HTML form and gave each other some time to investigate on our own.
We came back with new ideas and were able to integrate the customer in adequate form inputs: we get rid of the validation step by using a drop down menu, making sure that the customer will only pick an existing pizza type.
We are satisfied with the old fashion feeling of our bot layout.

We have tested the web page with good results in Chrome, Edge and Safari, on PC, McBook, iPad Pro and iPhone. As a last adjustement, we made sure that the last bubble is visible in the window without manual scrolling.

If we had more time, we would have added some pizza types and images.
